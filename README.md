# Python for Everybody Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed from the "Python for Everybody" specialization on Coursera. Each folder includes a project with its description, solution code, and output images.

## Projects

1. [**Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)**](project_1_programming_for_everybody/)
   - **Description:** In this project, I applied fundamental programming concepts using Python. It involves basic operations such as variables, expressions, and control structures to develop a simple Python program that processes user input and performs calculations.

2. [**Python Data Structures**](project_2_python_data_structures/)
   - **Description:** This project highlights Python’s built-in data structures, including lists, dictionaries, and tuples. I focused on manipulating and processing data with these structures and implementing various data processing tasks and algorithms.

3. [**Using Python to Access Web Data**](project_3_web_data_access/)
   - **Description:** Here, I tackled web scraping and data extraction from web pages. Using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`, I parsed HTML content and extracted relevant data for analysis, handling web data programmatically.

4. [**Using Databases with Python**](project_4_databases/)
   - **Description:** This project involved integrating Python with databases using SQL. I created, queried, and managed databases, performed data retrieval, and updated records using Python’s `sqlite3` library.

5. [**Capstone Project**](project_5_capstone/)
   - **Description:** For the capstone project, I consolidated all the skills learned throughout the specialization into a comprehensive task. This end-to-end project included data collection, analysis, web scraping, and database management to solve a real-world problem or conduct an in-depth analysis.

Feel free to explore the projects and their respective folders for detailed information, code, and results.
