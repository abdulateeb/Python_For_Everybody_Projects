# Python for Everybody Projects

This repository contains the projects from the "Python for Everybody" specialization on Coursera. Each folder includes a project with its description, solution code, and output images.

## Projects

1. [**Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)**](project_1_programming_for_everybody/)
   - **Description:** This project introduces fundamental programming concepts using Python. It involves basic operations such as variables, expressions, and control structures. The project focuses on developing a simple Python program that processes user input and performs calculations.

2. [**Python Data Structures**](project_2_python_data_structures/)
   - **Description:** This project emphasizes Python’s built-in data structures, including lists, dictionaries, and tuples. It involves manipulating and processing data using these structures, as well as implementing various data processing tasks and algorithms.

3. [**Using Python to Access Web Data**](project_3_web_data_access/)
   - **Description:** The focus of this project is on web scraping and data extraction from web pages. Using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`, you will parse HTML content and extract relevant data for analysis. The project includes tasks related to accessing and handling web data programmatically.

4. [**Using Databases with Python**](project_4_databases/)
   - **Description:** This project covers the integration of Python with databases using SQL. It involves creating, querying, and managing databases, with tasks such as data retrieval, updating records, and handling SQL commands using Python’s `sqlite3` library.

5. [**Capstone Project**](project_5_capstone/)
   - **Description:** The capstone project integrates the skills learned throughout the specialization into a comprehensive task. It involves a complete end-to-end project that may include data collection, analysis, web scraping, and database management to solve a real-world problem or conduct an in-depth analysis.

Feel free to explore the projects and their respective folders for detailed information, code, and results.
